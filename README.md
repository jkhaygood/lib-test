This is a just small project I did to test some of my C++ knowledge.
I'm still in the begning stages of learning C++, but I wanted to get away from the instructor and test my knowledge.

If you have any tips or questions about the code can reach me at jasonkhaygood@gmail.com or on Twitter @jasonkhaygood.

You can use the code as you wish, if you trust it.
